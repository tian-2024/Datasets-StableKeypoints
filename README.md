# Keypoints-Dataset

Recently, I came across an intriguing project called StableKeypoints, which was published at CVPR 2024.

I attempted to run the project using its dataset but encountered some issues with almost every dataset.

After searching for solutions on the website and experimenting with the code, I managed to resolve most of these problems.

To make it more convenient for myself and others in the future, I am compiling some useful resources here.

There are 5 datasets used in the project:
1. CelebA
2. CUB
3. DeepFashion
4. Taichi
5. Human3.6m

## CelebA

## DeepFashion
