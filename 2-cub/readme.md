https://github.com/akanazawa/cmr/issues/3


Then, use the cub_preprocess.py to preprocess the dataset:

https://github.com/xingzhehe/AutoLink-Self-supervised-Learning-of-Human-Skeletons-and-Object-Outlines-by-Linking-Keypoints/blob/main/datasets/preprocess/cub_preprocess.py

It will generate cub.h5.

Then, it can be directly used for training and testing.
